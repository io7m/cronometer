This is a scratch page right now for important nuances and issues that should be discussed in the user manual.

Not all nutrients in database are 'complete'. Some nutrients are under-represented in the
USDA data-set, so it may appear as if you are deficient in those particular nutrients when
the case is that any foods are simply lacking any information for those nutrients.

* Am I deficient or is the Database?

Vitamin D, for instance, is heavily underrepresented. It's high in many fishes like
tuna and salmon, but most USDA entries on salmon and tuna lack information for Vitamin D.

Hidden feature: Multiple profiles

If you pass it a single command line argument, it will create/load under a new account by that name. For example:

    ./Cronometer.exe Jon1

Would load up the 'Jon1' profile instead of the default.

Note: It doesn't currently show the name anywhere, so you'd have to handle that detail yourself for the time being.

USDA sr19 deprecated some foods from USDAsr18. The foods have been kept for
backwards compatibility, but it is recommend you no longer use them. They will
show up as light grey in the search and food listings. These items were removed
because either the nutritional data is considered out of date and/or the product
is no longer available on the market.

Scientific Tasks

   -- Read *carefully* through the USDA documentation and compile a list of important issues to consider
       -- find out which data may be unreliable and what nutrients are systematically underrepresented in the data

   -- Read carefully through DRIs for issues
   		--  double check the values in nutrients.xml for mistakes
   		-- add missing data
   		-- double check algorithms and assumptions made in software
