  <h3>USDA sr19</h3>The USDA food database has been upgraded to the
  most recent release. In addition to adding and updating many
  foods with more recent data, Cronometer now adds data for
  Choline, Caffeine, and Fluoride. Note that data for Choline and
  Fluoride may be under-represented in the data. Some foods that
  existed in sr18 have been deleted in sr19. We've kept these foods
  for backwards compatibility, but they will show up in the program
  greyed-out with accompanying warnings.

  <h3>Updated CRDB</h3>The special CRDB (CR Community Food
  Database) has been updated with new data for <i>Brewer's Yeast
  Lewis Labs</i>. The USDA's entry for Almond Butter, Unsalted is
  missing data for Vitamin E. A corrected entry was added to the
  CRDB. We've added several new foods submitted by Michael Rae and
  Aaron Davidson. As always, we welcome quality submissions from
  our user community for inclusion in the next release.

  <h3>Nutrient Editors</h3>In the food editor, there is now a
  distinction made between a nutrient having a known amount of 0
  and missing data. Nutrients with no data are shown in grey.
