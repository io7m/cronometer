  <h2>Daily Summary</h2>

  <h3>Entering Daily Consumption</h3>Select the date for which you
  want to enter your consumption. Click on the "Add Serving"
  icon&nbsp; <img src="addserving.png" width="92" height="19"
  title="" alt="" class="va-middle" />&nbsp; to open a dialog box
  with the food database.<br />
  <br />

  <div align="center">

    "" />
  </div>

  <p>Search the data base for the foods that you consume, select by
  clicking the appropriate entry, and then click the "Add" button.
  For example, suppose that you ate a McDonald's Big Mac for lunch.
  When you search for "mcdonald's", there will be a list of
  McDonald's products. Click once on "McDONALD'S, BIG MAC" (Don't
  double click because that will bring the food editing panel).
  Click on the portion size pull-down menu which will display "g"
  (gram) or "item". Select "item", and then click the "Add" button.
  The food will be added to the right side of the screen for the
  corresponding day.</p><br />

  <p>The distribution of macronutrients relative to the targets is
  immediately displayed in the colorful bars and the pie-chart of
  the summary. The numbers in parentheses give you the percentages
  of your daily targets. You can then say: "Wow! 51% of the
  calories of a Big Mac come from fat!!!" (the red part of the
  circle). Hopefully, you can make better choices for the rest of
  the day. Cronometer will help to keep you on track.</p>

  <p>Notice that the percentages on the bar chart for Protein,
  Carbohydrates, and Lipids are the percentages of the gram
  amounts, whereas the pie-chart represents the percentages of the
  total calories for each of these macronutrients. The Calories
  from alcohol, which contains approximately 7 Calories per gram,
  are represented as a lime-green sector in the pie-chart, and
  included in the total calories. There is no bar graph for alcohol
  since there is no minimum requirement.</p><br />

  </ul>Clicking on the <b>date</b> opens a calendar that allows
  selection of a date to display.<br />

  <h4>Setting Nutritional Targets</h4>The default nutritional
  values provided by Cronometer are based on the official Dietary
  Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the USDA. You can change these
  values to implement any diet. Using the tabs, navigate to any
  particular nutrient, double click on the value that you want to
  modify, and enter a new value using the keyboard.<br />
