  <h2>Setting Nutritional Targets</h2>

  <p>When you first run Cronometer you will be asked to set your
  nutritional targets for the first time. You can always come back
  and change these later. You can either have the program set
  default values for your body-type, or manually set them to custom
  values.</p>

  <p>Set your nutritional targets for tracking within the program.
  Every nutrient has a target minimum and maximum. The minimum
  should be set to the minimum amount you want to consume daily.
  The maximum should be set to an amount you never want to exceed.
  For instance, the toxicity levels of that nutrient should never
  be exceeded. As you approach a maximum target, the progress bars
  will go bright red to warn you of the danger.</p>

  <p>Clicking 'Set to Dietary Reference Intakes' will set all the
  targets to values configured for your weight, height, gender,
  age, and activity level. These values are based on the DRIs
  published by USDA. Please note that DRIs are not specified for
  all nutrients, and so many values will remain unchanged. You may
  also edit the targets directly in the table to the right choosing
  customized values for your tracking.</p>

  <p>The default nutritional values provided by Cronometer are
  based on the official Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the
  USDA. You can change these values to implement any diet. Using
  the tabs, navigate to any particular nutrient, double click on
  the value that you want to modify, and enter a new value using
  the keyboard.</p>

  <p>To ignore certain nutrients you may not be interested in,
  toggle off the tracking checkbox for that nutrient to hide it
  within the software. Some nutrients are not tracked by default.
  Some values have little to no data available in the nutrition
  database, and so a user must understand these limitations before
  interpreting tracking data for these nutrients.</p><br />
