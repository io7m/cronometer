  <h2>Creating a Food</h2>Because of the large number of food
  products available to consumers, it is very likely that you use a
  food that is not listed in the database. In this case, you will
  need to create a new food. You can use the "Food - Create New
  Food" function on the Menu Bar, or if there is something similar
  in the database, you can export it and then import it, rename it,
  and edit it. Basically, you need to specify the name of the food,
  the quantity for which you have nutritional data, and then enter
  the detailed quantity of nutrients under each of the tabs
  below.<br />

  <h3>Importing a Food</h3>Click on "Food - Import Food" function
  to display a file dialog panel. Select the <i>.xml</i> file and
  click on the Open button. The imported food will be placed in My
  Foods category.

  <h3>Exporting a Food</h3>This function provides a way of sharing
  your recipes by creating a file with an <i>.xml</i> extension
  that can be sent to another Cronometer user. Click on the food to
  select it, and then click the Export Food icon <img src=
  "export.png" width="22" height="18" title="" alt="" class=
  "va-middle" />, or right click on the food that you want to
  export, and click the "Export Food" icon from the pull-down menu
  that appears by the cursor. The dialog box lets you specify the
  folder where you would like to save the recipe or food.<br />
