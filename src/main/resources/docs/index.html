  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>The data displayed in this software should
  always be treated as a rough estimate. The data itself may
  contain errors or be incomplete. The USDA food database, for
  instance, contains average values for most foods. Local soil and
  growing conditions can deviate largely from the average values.
  Some nutrients are underrepresented in the database because not
  every food item has undergone comprehensive analysis.
  Furthermore, this software may contain unknown bugs that affect
  the reported values. You should not use this program to make
  life-critical decisions.<br>

  <h3>Installation</h3>Download and execute the Cronometer setup
  program. You can use the default installation directories, or
  choose your own. If the program does not start after
  installation, the most likely cause is that a Java environment
  needs to be enabled.<br>
  The Java software can be downloaded free at: <a href=
  "http://www.java.com/en/">http://www.java.com/en/</a>.<br>
  You can also manually select Java for various versions of Linux
  and Solaris at: <a href=
  "http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>.<br>

  Java for Apple computers can be downloaded by searching for
  "download Java" at <a href=
  "http://www.apple.com/">http://www.apple.com/</a>.

  <p align="justify"><b>Updating Versions</b>.<br>
  When a new version of Cronometer is available, just run the new
  setup program. Any data that you previously entered will be
  retained.</p>

  <h3>Program Functions</h3><b>Creating a Food</b><br>
  Because of the large number of food products available to
  consumers, it is very likely that you use a food that is not
  listed in the database. In this case, you will need to create a
  new food. You can use the "Create New Food" function, or if there
  is something similar in the database, you can export it and then
  import it, rename it, and edit it. Basically, you need to specify
  the name of the food, the quantity for which you have nutritional
  data, and then enter the detailed quantity of nutrients under
  each of the tabs below.

  <p><img src="nutrition.png" width="279" height="26" alt=
  "Nutrition tabs"></p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Exporting a Food</b><br>
  This function provides a way of sharing your recipes by creating
  a file with an <i>.xml</i> extension that can be sent to another
  Cronometer user. Click on the food to select it, and then click
  the Export Food icon, or right click on the food that you want to
  export, and click the "Export Food" icon from the pull-down menu
  that appears by the cursor.</p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Importing a Food</b><br>
  Click on the Import Food function to display a file dialog panel.
  Select the <i>.xml</i> file and click on the Open button. The
  imported food will be placed in My Foods category.</p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Creating a Recipe</b><br>
  On the Menu Bar, click on "Foodâ†’Create New Recipe". Under the
  "Recipe" tab click the Add icon <img src="add.png" width="33"
  height="33" alt="Add" class="va-middle"><br>
  <br>
  <img src="newfood.png" width="280" height="209" alt=
  "New Food"></p>

  <p align="justify">This causes the "Select a Food" panel to
  display. You can now type the name of the first food ingredient
  for your recipe. Select the ingredient by clicking on it, enter a
  weight, and click the "ADD" button. Repeat the procedure for each
  ingredient. In the recipe, you can adjust the amount of each
  ingredient by double clicking the amount field and typing a new
  value. Similarly, by double clicking the calories, you can type a
  new number and the weight will be adjusted accordingly. Foods may
  be removed from the recipe by clicking on them and then clicking
  on the trash can icon.</p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Setting Nutritional Targets</b><br>
  The default nutritional values provided by Cronometer are based
  on the official Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) set by the USDA.
  You can change these values to implement any diet. Using the
  tabs, navigate to any particular entry and double-click to
  display a customization panel corresponding to the entry. The
  illustration below shows the cursor on the "Energy" entry and its
  control panel.</p>

  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="nutrient.png" width="150"
      height="141" alt=""></td>

      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

      <td align="center"><img src="nutrient1.png" width="333"
      height="209" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p align="justify"><b>Entering Daily Consumption</b><br>
  Select the date for which you want to enter your consumption.
  Search the data base for the foods that you consume, select by
  clicking the appropriate entry, and then click the "Add" button.
  For example, suppose that you ate a McDonald's Big Mac for lunch.
  When you search for "mcdonald's", there will be a list of
  McDonald's products. Click once on "McDONALD'S, BIG MAC" (Don't
  double click because that will bring the food editing panel).
  Click on the portion size pull-down menu which will display "g"
  (gram) or "item". Select "item", and then click the "Add" button.
  The food will be added to the right side of the screen for the
  corresponding day.</p>

  <p><img src="addfood.png" width="536" height="322" alt=
  "Add food"></p>

  <p align="justify">The distribution of macronutrients relative to
  the targets is immediately displayed in the colorful bars and the
  pie-chart of the summary. The numbers in parentheses give you the
  percentages of your daily targets. You can then say: "Wow! 53% of
  the calories of a Big Mac come from fat!!!" (the red part of the
  circle). Hopefully, you can make better choices for the rest of
  the day. Cronometer will help to keep you on track.</p>

  <p><img src="summary1.png" width="376" height="440" alt=
  "Summary"><br></p>

  <p align="justify"><b>Entering Biomarkers</b><br>
  Click on the "Biomarkers" tab for a specific date. Click on the
  check box of the specific biomarker that you want to track
  (Weight, Body Temperature, Systolic, or Diastolic Blood
  Pressure). Enter a numeric value. Note that there are no units
  associated with any of these biomarkers. Therefore, you can enter
  your weight in pounds or kilograms, and your temperature in
  either Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees. Clicking on the
  corresponding graph icons for each biomarker will display a chart
  of the variations over time.</p>

  <h3>Feedback</h3>This software is made by an all-volunteer
  effort. If you want to chip in and lend a hand there are lots of
  things you can do to improve the program. Besides programmers, we
  could use:

  <ul>
    <li>Technical writing skills to make a user-friendly help
    manual</li>

    <li>Custom art work for icons and aesthetics</li>

    <li>Scientific accuracy -- help find errors, bugs, or improve
    the nutritional analysis</li>

    <li>A library of food entries that could be shared on the
    Internet by Cronometer users</li>
  </ul>If you wish to contribute, contact <b>aaron@spaz.ca</b>
