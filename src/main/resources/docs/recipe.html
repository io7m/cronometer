  On the Menu Bar, click on "Food - Create New Recipe". A dialog
  box enables you to name the recipe and specify ingredients and
  amounts. Click on the "Add Serving" icon <img src=
  "addserving.png" width="92" height="19" title="" alt="" class=
  "va-middle" />.&nbsp; This causes the "Select a Food" panel to
  display. You can now type the name of the first food ingredient
  for your recipe. Select the ingredient by clicking on it, enter a
  weight, and click the "ADD" button. Repeat the procedure for each
  ingredient. In the recipe, you can adjust the amount of each
  ingredient by double clicking the amount field and typing a new
  value. Similarly, by double clicking the calories, you can type a
  new number and the weight will be adjusted accordingly. Foods may
  be removed from the recipe by clicking on them and then clicking
  on the trash can icon. Click the "Save" button to save the
  recipe.
