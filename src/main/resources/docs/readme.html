  <h1 align="center">PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</h1>This tool helps you
  track your nutrition. Please understand that the data displayed
  in this software should always be treated as a rough estimate,
  not the gospel truth. The data itself may contain errors or be
  incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance, contains
  average values for most foods. Local soil and growing conditions
  can deviate largely from the average values. Some nutrients are
  underrepresented in the database because not every food item has
  undergone comprehensive analysis. Furthermore, this software may
  contain unknown bugs that affect the reported values. Thus it is
  essential that you do not use this program to make life-critical
  decisions.<br>

  <h2>You get what you pay for</h2>This software is provided
  free-of-charge, and is the result of countless hours of work by
  the developers. We continue to work on this software and support
  it at our own leisure. However, if you have an important
  'must-have' feature, we will accept bribes.

  <h2>Help Wanted</h2>This software is made by an all-volunteer
  effort. If you want to chip in and lend a hand there are lots of
  things you can do to improve the program. Besides programmers, we
  could use:

  <ul>
    <li>Technical writing skills to make a user-friendly help
    manual</li>

    <li>Custom art work for icons and aesthetics</li>

    <li>Scientific accuracy -- help find errors, bugs, or improve
    the nutritional analysis</li>
  </ul>If you wish to contribute, contact aaron@spaz.ca.
