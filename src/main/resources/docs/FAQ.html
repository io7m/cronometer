  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>This section answers some
  frequently-asked questions.

  <h4>One of the foods has an error in the nutrients, what should I
  do?</h4>Cronometer has 3 databases:

  <ul>
    <li><b>My Foods</b> which is your personal food list with the
    nutrition information that you have provided</li>

    <li><b>CRDB</b> which contains some foods frequently used by
    CRONies with the nutrition data originally provided by the
    contributors</li>

    <li><b>USDA</b> which is the nutrition database provided by the
    <a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/" target=
    "_blank">USDA</a>.</li>
  </ul>We recently learned that unsalted almond butter (USDA 12195)
  had a Vitamin E amount zero, whereas salted almond butter (USDA
  12695) had the correct amount of Vitamin E. Inconsistencies in
  the USDA database may eventually be corrected by the government,
  but by editing the data yourself, you can use more accurate data
  immediately. Any deficiencies in the databases can be corrected
  by editing the food, saving it in "My Foods", and then using the
  edited food in your recipes or daily menus. <!-- ===== -->

  <h4>I recently got a new computer. How do I transfer my
  Cronometer data to the new computer?</h4>For MS Windows, the
  default profile for Cronometer is located in a folder called
  "cronometer" at:

  <blockquote>
    <tt>C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application
    Data\cronometer</tt>
  </blockquote>Where "Owner" is your logon ID name, e.g., "John
  Smith".

  <p>The "Application Data" folder is a system folder that will not
  be visible unless you specify that hidden files and folders
  should be displayed. You can do this from the "Tools" function in
  the menu bar of a window.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
Tools-&gt;Folder Options-&gt;View
  Advanced settings:
   Hidden files and folders:
    o Show hidden files and folders
</pre>
  </blockquote>Just copy the "cronometer" folder from the old
  computer to the corresponding location in the new computer,
  install Cronometer from the web on your new computer, and you are
  set. The process is similar for other operating systems.
