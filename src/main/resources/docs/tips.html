  <h2>Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>

  <h4>Cut, Copy, and Paste Shortcuts</h4>Standard keyboard
  shortcuts for Cut, Copy and Paste will work on selected items in
  your daily listing. For example, you can easily copy a selection
  of foods and paste them into a different day. You can also paste
  the results into a text editor.

  <h4>Keyboard accelerators for food entry</h4>There are also many
  ways to accelerate through data entry with the keyboard.
  Control-E (Command-E on Max OS X) will bring up the food search
  dialog.

  <p>If the top ranked search result is what you're looking for,
  hitting enter will auto-select it. When you select a food, the
  keyboard focus automatically transfers to the amount field.
  Hitting enter after typing an amount will automatically add the
  food. Tab will select the Measure menu and you can use the arrow
  keys to page through them. You can actually enter foods without
  ever touching the mouse.</p>
