  <h2>Limitations</h2>

  <div id="alert">
    The developers of this software accept no liability in the use
    of this software. Use at your own risk. It is up to you to
    understand the risks and limitations of the software.
  </div>

  <p>Be careful before drawing conclusions from your nutritional
  summaries. Always consult your physician before making
  significant changes to your diet or supplementation.</p>

  <h4>Nutriton Data</h4>The results displayed are only as good as
  the data the program has for the various foods you enter. In many
  cases the data may be incomplete, incorrect, or simply different
  (was the apple you ate grown in different soil than the ones
  studied for the data?).

  <p>The data displayed in this software should always be treated
  as a rough estimate. The data itself may contain errors or be
  incomplete. The USDA food database, for instance, contains
  average values for most foods. Local soil and growing conditions
  can deviate largely from the average values.</p>

  <h4>Underrepresented Nutrients</h4>Some nutrients are
  underrepresented in the database because not every food item has
  undergone comprehensive analysis. In particular, Fluoride,
  Choline, and Vitamin D are significantly lacking data.

  <p>For instance, values for Vitamin D are missing for many foods
  in the USDA nutrition data. Of the 7293 foods listed, only 510
  have values for Vitamin D. So if you appear chronically low on
  Vitamin D, it may be due to lack of data, not an actual
  deficiency in your diet!</p>

  <h4>Software Bugs</h4>This software may contain unknown bugs that
  affect the reported values. While we strive to ensure quality,
  the possibility of errors remains.
