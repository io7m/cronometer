    <h2>Cronometer</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Cronometer is <b>free</b>, <b>open source</b>, and
  <b>cross-platform</b> dieting software.</p>

  <p>CR (Calorie Reduced) diets require a lot of information to
  perform optimally. In order to restrict caloric intake, but
  remain healthy, users of the diet must track their vitamin,
  mineral, and protein intakes with great care.</p>

  <p>We aim to provide a complete solution to the CR dieter.
  Current open-source diet-tracking applications fall short in some
  vital respects. Either they are not detailed enough, or they
  suffer from critical usability flaws. We believe that a diet
  tracker must be effortless to operate for the activity for which
  it will be used most of the time, keeping track of the foods
  eaten in a particular meal.</p>

  <p>To this end, we are developing Cronometer, an application that
  will take into account good usability design and dense
  functionality. It will provide diet advice, track consumption and
  exercise, and generally assist in all aspects of a CR diet.</p>
