  <h2>Managing users</h2>

  <p>In Cronometer you can track multiple users diets in the same
  session. Cronometer will track your food servings, biomarkers,
  notes, dietary targets and body profile separately. It is
  possible to copy selected foods from one person to another person
  and to a given date. When you add a food for one user, it will be
  available for all users in the system. The name of the currently
  selected user will be displayed in the title bar of the
  Cronometer window. When you exit Cronometer and restart it again
  another time, the last selected user will be active.</p>

  <p>You can find the user manager dialog in the File menu. The
  user manager will allow you to add a user or delete a user. To
  switch between users click on the user you wish to switch to,
  this will immediately update the servings list to reflect the new
  user.</p><br />

  <h2>Copy servings to another user</h2>

  <p>Select the servings you wish to copy to another user, then
  from the "Edit" menu select "Copy To...". You will be asked to
  select the user to copy the servings to and the date to which
  where the copied servings should be placed.</p>
